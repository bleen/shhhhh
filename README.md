# Shhhhh!
This is an Alfred Workflow to close all open system notifications (iCal, etc) via a keyboard shortcut or keyword.

## Installation
Download from GitHub, unzip, and double-click on the `Shhhhh.alfredworkflow` file. This will add the workflow to Alfred and let you customize it. 

I have also included the original AppleScript (`Shhhhh.scpt`) if you prefer to install/use it via Script Editor.

## Compatibility
This should work in earlier versions of OSX, but I've only verified it in OSX Yosemite (10.10.2).

## Credit
I based this on the AppleScript found [here](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20140129221522629), and tweaked it until it worked right.
